# Oximeter_FPGA_EmbeddedC_GUI

The objective of the project is to design an electronic oxygen monitor using an embedded system. Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020 medium range FPGA board has been used along with PMOD connector which establish the interface between optical finger probe and FPGA. GUI has been designed to show the Heart beat rate and plethysmograph.
